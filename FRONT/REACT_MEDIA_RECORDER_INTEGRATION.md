# React Media Recorder Integration

This project now uses the `react-media-recorder` package for robust video recording functionality.

## Installation

To install the required dependency, run:

```bash
npm install react-media-recorder
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-media-recorder
```

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Enhanced Recording Page**
- **Professional camera interface** using `react-media-recorder`
- **Real-time camera preview** with immediate feed display
- **Robust error handling** with user-friendly error messages
- **Recording status indicators** with visual feedback
- **Download functionality** for recorded videos

### ✅ **Key Benefits of react-media-recorder**
- **Better browser compatibility** - handles different browser implementations
- **Built-in error handling** - comprehensive error states and messages
- **Automatic permission management** - asks for camera permissions on mount
- **Optimized performance** - efficient resource management
- **TypeScript support** - fully typed for better development experience

### ✅ **Recording Workflow**
1. **Page loads** → Camera permission requested automatically
2. **Live preview** → Real-time camera feed displayed immediately
3. **Start recording** → Visual indicator shows recording status
4. **Stop recording** → Preview of recorded video appears
5. **Save/Retake** → Download video or restart recording process

### ✅ **Error Handling**
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Camera permission denied
- Camera not found
- Camera in use by another application
- Invalid media constraints
- Recording errors

### ✅ **Mobile Optimization**
- **Responsive design** that works on all device sizes
- **Touch-friendly controls** optimized for mobile interaction
- **Full-screen camera feed** for better recording experience
- **Proper orientation handling** for mobile devices

## Usage

The recording functionality is now available at `/recording` route. Users can:

1. Click "Record your run" button on the Video page
2. Navigate to the dedicated recording page
3. Use the camera interface to record their running session
4. Preview and save the recorded video

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses two approaches:

1. **Hook-based approach** (`useReactMediaRecorder`) - for direct integration
2. **Component-based approach** (`ReactMediaRecorder`) - for render prop pattern

Both approaches provide the same functionality with different integration patterns, giving flexibility for different use cases.

## Browser Support

The `react-media-recorder` package provides excellent browser support for:
- Chrome/Chromium browsers
- Firefox
- Safari (with limitations)
- Edge
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Next Steps

The recorded video blob is ready for:
- **API integration** - send to backend for analysis
- **Cloud storage** - upload to cloud services
- **Local storage** - save to device storage
- **Real-time processing** - analyze video content

The implementation is production-ready and follows React best practices with proper error handling, resource management, and user experience considerations.
